I
AM
ANDREW
RYAN
AND
IM
HERE
TO
ASK
YOU
A
QUESTION
IS
A
MAN
NOT
ENTITLED
TO
THE
SWEAT
OF
HIS
BROW
NO
SAYS
THE
MAN
IN
WASHINGTON
IT
BELONGS
TO
THE
POOR
NO
SAYS
THE
MAN
IN
THE
VATICAN
IT
BELONGS
TO
GOD
NO
SAYS
THE
MAN
IN
MOSCOW
IT
BELONGS
TO
EVERYONE
I
REJECTED
THOSE
ANSWERS
INSTEAD
I
CHOSE
SOMETHING
DIFFERENT
I
CHOSE
THE
IMPOSSIBLE
I
CHOSE
RAPTURE
A
CITY
WHERE
THE
ARTIST
WOULD
NOT
FEAR
THE
CENSOR
WHERE
THE
SCIENTIST
WOULD
NOT
BE
BOUND
BY
PETTY
MORALITY
WHERE
THE
GREAT
WOULD
NOT
BE
CONSTRAINED
BY
THE
SMALL
AND
WITH
THE
SWEAT
OF
YOUR
BROW
RAPTURE
CAN
BECOME
YOUR
CITY
AS
WELL

WE
ALL
MAKE
CHOICES
BUT
IN
THE
END
OUR
CHOICES
MAKE
US
